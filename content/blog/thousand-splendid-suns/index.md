That moment when you finish reading the last word of Khaled Hosseini's _A Thousand Splendid Suns_ is indescribable. It is often followed by a deep silence as you try to take in all the tragedies and events. The characters become so real in your mind that you can see their faces, feel their pain, laugh with them, cry with them, and wait anxiously with them.

Khaled Hosseini, as always, makes you realise that for millions of unfortunate people around the world, especially in conflict and war zones, happy endings are not always possible. In the real world, there are no storybook heroes who escape every disaster and make their way through all challenges without a scratch towards a grand finale.

In reality, there are child victims. There are monsters who feed on human suffering. The political problems and disputes are enough to make one's hair turn grey. Millions of innocent people have lost the most precious things overnight. They have left their jobs, homes, possessions, and memories, fleeing towards safety.

It is very sad that these innocent people are often met with hatred, rejection, and pursuit, just because they belong to a certain homeland – a homeland torn apart by the hands of politicians, warlords, and power struggles.

Khaled Hosseini has a great talent for showing these harsh truths. Through his powerful storytelling, he stands against the cruel treatment of war victims and those fleeing in search of a safe and dignified life. _A Thousand Splendid Suns_ is not just a story; it is a strong reminder of the resilience of the human spirit in the face of great hardship.

Hosseini’s storytelling weaves a story of love, sacrifice, and endurance, highlighting the strength of women who survive despite the odds. He paints a touching picture of Afghanistan's troubled history, showing the personal impact of political and social problems on its people.

Thank you, Khaled Hosseini, and thanks to every dedicated writer who takes it upon themselves to tell the truth and stand against the awful disregard for the victims of wars and those seeking safety from conflict. Your work is a light of hope and a call for empathy for those who have lost everything yet continue to hope for a better future.
