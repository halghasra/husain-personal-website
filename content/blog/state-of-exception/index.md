> _"State of exception makes people feel that they have been turned into expendable beings, defenceless bodies, stripped of their identity and their right to belong, and thrown into a realm of prohibition."_

I chose to read Giorgio Agamben's _State of Exception_ because it connects deeply with the situation we have been experiencing daily for the past six years. We exist in a shapeless void outside the realm of politics and law – a state of exception. This book provided a profound understanding of our current reality, offering a framework to understand the ongoing complexities we face.

Agamben’s work examines how governments, in times of crisis, suspend normal laws and declare a state of exception. In such times, the rule of law is often set aside, and individuals find themselves in a grey area where their rights are diminished or entirely removed. This state of exception becomes a tool for authorities to maintain control, often at the expense of personal freedoms and human rights.

Authorities, regardless of time and place, share common characteristics. For thousands of years, "sovereignty" has been above the law, shaping and tailoring its rules and chapters according to need and convenience. Agamben shows how this pattern has persisted throughout history, with sovereign power manipulating legal frameworks to consolidate its authority.

Reading this book did not merely help me understand the legal aspects of states of exception or emergencies, as they are now called. It provided a way to reflect on my daily experiences. The book helped me see the underlying reasons behind the continuous legal decisions and amendments that are often justified by the need for security and stability.

Agamben’s work extends beyond theory; it is a call to recognize the fragility of our rights in the face of unchecked power. The philosopher looks at historical examples, such as the Roman dictatorship and the Weimar Republic, to show how states of exception have been used to justify extraordinary measures. These historical parallels are very relevant today as we see similar reasons given for the suspension of normal legal processes.

One of the most striking aspects of Agamben’s work is his discussion on the impact of the state of exception on individual identity and belonging. When laws are suspended, people are reduced to "bare life," stripped of their personal and social identities. This resonated with me deeply as I thought about how many individuals and communities have experienced this sense of dispossession and marginalization in recent years.

The knowledge gained from _State of Exception_ has encouraged me to read more of Agamben’s works, especially his _Homo Sacer_ series. These books promise to further expand my understanding of how sovereign power operates and impacts human life.

In conclusion, _State of Exception_ is a powerful and timely book that sheds light on the mechanisms of power and control in times of crisis. It challenges us to critically examine the balance between security and freedom and to remain vigilant in protecting our rights against the encroachment of authoritarian measures. Agamben’s work is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the complex interplay between law, politics, and individual freedoms in our contemporary world.
