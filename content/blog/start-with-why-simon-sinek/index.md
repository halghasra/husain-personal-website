I had this book on my Kindle for years and never got the time (nor the desire) to start reading it. Not until the beginning of this year, when I was traveling back and forth and had the need to spend countless dull hours in ‘lounge-less’ airports. However this book didn’t serve me well. I lost interest in few pages and caught myself reading without comprehension many times. It is not that there were anything wrong with the general idea of the book, it is a great idea actually but not for a 255 pages book.

That was my initial thought of this book. I didn’t even realize when did I stop reading or at which page, but I guess once I reached home and stowed the Kindle device inside the drawer of my side table, I totally forgot about it until I charged it again.

I decided to give the book a second chance, I started to flip the pages trying to catch up, and it was no different this time. I headed to google and there I found an 18-minutes TED talk for the same author describing his general idea (I guess the video was prior to releasing the book), and boy wasn’t I excited!

I fell in love with his idea at first sight. It was too simple but with a glimpse of greatness. The way he delivers it makes it even more exciting. I got to give it to him, Simon Sinek is a gifted man and a brilliant speaker.

In the next post, I will be writing specifically about the idea of **_“Start with Why: How great leaders inspire actions_**.” and explain his concepts the way I perceived them, and will try to list a refreshed examples since his TED talk video (along with the book) came out about 12 years ago.

Stay tuned!
